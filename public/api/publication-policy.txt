About the data:

Data is drawn from several procurement systems, including: SIMDA (e-budget), SiRUP (e-procurement planning), LPSE (e-tender), and e-kontrak (contract details for non-competitive procurement).

The Government of Bandung City encourages users from all sectors of society (government, private sector, civil society) to visit the website regularly, subscribe to updates on tender opportunities or information on specific contracts, and put this data into use.
