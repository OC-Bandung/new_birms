## Endless possibilities

Besides the endpoints presented in this API documentation, the MongoDB Query Language provides endless possibilities. We put the power of MongoDB Query Language - a full-featured query language - at your fingertips. Imagine being able to query an API with sql-like parameters. This is exactly what's happening here, except you will be using queries represented in a JSON-like structure. It gives you endless possibilities for what you can query and build.

MongoDB provides detailed documentation for how to use the MongoDB Query language. The documentation can be found on: [https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/query-documents/](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/query-documents/). There are also tons of online tutorials, classes, forums and blogs that discuss MongoDB Query Language.
